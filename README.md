# OOP_UserInterface

The PHP code creates three classes - User, Admin, and Customer - to model a simple user system. The User class has properties id, username, email, and password, and a constructor to initialize these properties. The Admin class inherits from the User class and adds a method uploadProduct to simulate product upload. The Customer class also inherits from User and adds a method viewProduct to simulate product viewing.

The HTML form (index.html) has two sections - an Admin Section and a Customer Section. The Admin Section allows the admin to input their username, password, product name, and product image URL for product upload. The Customer Section allows the customer to input their username and password for product viewing.
